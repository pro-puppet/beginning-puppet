# Beginning Puppet

This repository contains the different code samples from the Beginning Puppet book.

The code samples fall under the same copyright and licenses as the book when it will be published by Apress.

Travis has been hooked into this repository to ensure that our code adheres to the style guide and doesn't contain other errors.
